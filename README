-The code reads the file "edges" and makes a matrix CONEX, in which lines represent all the nodes i and the columns represent the nodes j which are directed connected do the the node i.

Example:

file:

1 2
3 5
7 1
8 2
7 2
2 3

Then CONEX matrix would be:

2 7 none none none none none none
1 8  7    3   none none none none
5 2  0
none...
3 0 none...
none none none none none ...
1 2 none ..
2 none..
