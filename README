-The code read the file "edges" and makes a matrix CONEX, in which lines represent all the nodes i and the columns represent the nodes j which are directed connected do the the node i.

Example:

file:

1 2
3 5
7 1
8 2
7 2
2 3

Then CONEX matrix would be:

2 7 none none none none none none
1 8  7    3   none none none none
5 2  0
none...
3 0 none...
none none none none none ...
1 2 none ..
2 none..

I did not know how to program in Python and neither anything about graph theory (and I did not know how to use Git ), so i have to apologize but this was all I got time to do, since I had to learn almost everything from scratch. I have tried to carry on but I could not finish (my trials are commented in the code). I am aware that there are algorithms to find short path and everything, but I have tried to do it my way and I could not. If I had more time, I would try to programm one of this algorithms and then calculate closeness centrality.
